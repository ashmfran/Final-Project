      <p>The killings of four University of Idaho students in mid-November at an off-campus residence stunned the small
         community of Moscow, where investigators grappled with what the town's police chief would later describe as a "very
         complex" case.</p>
      <p>No suspect was immediately named in the deaths of housemates Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana
         Kernodle, 20, as well as Kernodle's boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20. Nor was a murder weapon, believed to be a large
         fixed-blade knife, found.</p>
